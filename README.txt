This is the repository that we will use to work on the recording and procesing of skin signals. 

Tailun, your first goal is to generate a code which generates data files from 8 Strain Gauges at the same time. 

I (Dar√≠o), need to be able to work with this code, in my own computer and DAQ system (i.e. Arduino).
You are in charge about the procedures involved in recording the data (from electronics hardware to code to read signals)
